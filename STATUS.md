## Security Posture Summary

### Current Security Level: **HIGH** üîí

- **Encryption**: Military-grade end-to-end encryption with OpenPGP
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor with optional WebAuthn passkeys  
- **Access Control**: Zero-trust model with comprehensive RLS
- **Data Protection**: Client-side encryption, server never sees plaintext
- **Network Security**: CSP, SRI, secure headers, HTTPS enforcement
- **Attack Prevention**: XSS, CSRF, injection, and tampering protection

### Risk Assessment: **LOW** üìä

The implemented security measures provide comprehensive protection against:
- External attacks (network-based)
- Internal threats (compromised server)
- Client-side attacks (XSS, tampering)
- Social engineering (verification workflows)
- Data breaches (zero-knowledge architecture)

### Compliance Status: **READY** ‚úÖ

- Privacy-by-design architecture
- No PII stored in plaintext
- User data sovereignty
- Audit trail capabilities
- Incident response procedures documented
